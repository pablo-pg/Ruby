Here there is some projects i've done using Ruby.  

The structure is:  

* basics: some basics about the language: hello world, how to define functions or classes, etc,
* POO: Advanced POO: The scheme of classes hierarchy in Ruby and the definition of a more complex class with mixins and inheritance
* granja-pablo-pg: My first Ruby Gem: A complete project of a gem, using TDD, modules, classes inheritance, functional programming, collecting data from csv and a basic DSL about a bird farm
* tests: Some exercises about lambdas and some statement of different exercises
